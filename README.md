## What Smart Contracts can do 

- Create forwarding contracts, such as a savings account that resends income to a separate bucket automatically
- Manage a relationship between several parties, such as a freelancer agreement or payroll
- Act as a software library for other contracts
- Act as controllers for other systems or sets of contracts
- Serve as application-specific logic for a communal web service
- Maintain an accounting system for something in the real world, or for other contracts
- Serve as a utility that developers can use on a single-serving basis, such as a random number generator
